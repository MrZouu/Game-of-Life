# Game-of-Life
Implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C. The Game of Life is a classic simulation that demonstrates the emergence of complex patterns from simple rules.

##  Description
Game of Life, is an example of a zero-player “game” known as a cellular automaton. It consists of a two-dimensional world, divided into “cells”. extending infinitely in all directions.

⚠️This project is the result of a common work, made for school with a deadline and we chose to leave it as it was at the time of submission

## Rules
The set of rules described by Conway are summarized as:
1. A living cell will die if it has fewer than two living neighbors. (case of solitude)
2. A living cell will also die if it has more than three live neighbors. (case of overcrowding)
3. A living cell will survive if it has exactly two or three living neighbors.
4. A dead cell will become alive if it has exactly three living neighbors.

## Project
Notre projet est divisé en deux parties. 
In part A, named "Implementing Evolution", we will focus on implementing the rules needed to evolve the world from
one generation to the next.
In part B, named "The World in a File", we will modify the code so that the initial state of the world can be read from a file, and the final state is output to a file.
